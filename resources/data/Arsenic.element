Appearance=Although it is now strongly linked with poison, arsenic was once used widely as a medicine. Dr Fowlerâ€™s Solution (potassium arsenate dissolved in water) was a popular cure-all tonic in Victorian times - even Charles Dickens used it. Arsenic compounds are still employed in making special glass and semi-conductors (gallium arsenide), preserving wood and, in some countries, to fatten poultry and pigs. Nowadays its use is strictly controlled, although some scientists claim it is an essential element in our diet in very low doses. Some foods such as prawns contain a surprising amount of arsenic.
Uses=Arsenic is used in bronzing, pyrotechnics and for hardening shot. It is increasingly being used as a doping agent in solid state devices.
Biological_role=Arsenic may be an essential element, but it is certainly toxic in small doses and also a suspected carcinogen. Calcium and lead arsenic compounds are used as poisons for vermin.
Natural_abundance=The most common arsenic-containing mineral is mispickel, and others include realgar and orpiment. Arsenic can also be found in the native state. It can be obtained from mispickel by heating, which causes the arsenic to sublime and leaves the iron(II) sulfide.
