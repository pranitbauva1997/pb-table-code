Appearance= A silvery white, soft metal that reacts with water. It is used in alloys and in the extraction of other metals, such as thorium, from their ores. Calcium is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. There are vast deposits of limestone (calcium carbonate); when heated in kilns, this gives off carbon dioxide gas to leave quicklime (calcium oxide). This reacts violently with water to give slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). This is used to make cement, as a soil conditioner and in water treatment to reduce acidity, and in the chemicals industry. Calcium is essential to all living things, and calcium phosphate is the main component of bone. The average human contains about 1 kilogramme of calcium. Children and pregnant women are encouraged to eat foods rich in calcium, such as cheese, milk and white bread, to promote the growth of healthy teeth and bones.
Uses= Calcium and its compounds are widely used. It is used in alloys and in the extraction of other metals, such as thorium, from their ores. There are vast deposits of limestone (calcium carbonate); when heated in kilns, this gives off carbon dioxide gas to leave quicklime (calcium oxide). This reacts violently with water to give slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). This is used to make cement, as a soil conditioner and in water treatment to reduce acidity, and in the chemicals industry. It has the advantage of being cheap and readily available. When mixed with sand it takes up carbon dioxide from the air and hardens as mortar and plaster. Calcium from limestone is an important constituent of Portland Cement. Calcium is also used as a reducing agent in preparing other metals such as thorium and uranium, and as an alloying agent for aluminium, beryllium, copper, lead and magnesium alloys.
Biological_role=Calcium is essential to all living things, and calcium phosphate is the main component of bone. The average human contains about 1 kilogramme of calcium. Children and pregnant women are encouraged to eat foods rich in calcium, such as cheese, milk and white bread, to promote the growth of healthy teeth andones.
Natural_abundance=Calcium is the fifth most abundant metal in the Earthâ€™s crust, greater than 3% by mass. It is not found uncombined in nature, but occurs abundantly as limestone (calcium carbonate), gypsum (calcium sulphate), fluorite (calcium fluoride) and apatite (calcium chloro- or fluoro-phosphate). Calcium is prepared commercially by the electrolysis of fused calcium chloride to which calcium fluoride is added to lower the melting point.
