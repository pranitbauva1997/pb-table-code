Appearance=A colourless, odourless gas that makes up 0.086 parts per million of the atmosphere. About half a tonne a year is produced from liquid air and used for research purposes.
Uses=Xenon is little used outside research. However, it is used in certain specialised light sources which require an instant, intense light such as the high-speed electronic flash bulbs used by photographers. The high volatility of this elementâ€™s electron structure produces this type of light. Xenon in a vacuum tube produces a beautiful blue glow when excited by an electrical discharge, and finds application in electron tubes, stroboscopic lights and bactericidal lamps.
Biological_role=Xenon has no known biological role. It is not itself toxic, but its compounds are highly toxic because of their strong oxidising characteristics.
Natural_abundance=Xenon is present in the atmosphere at a concentration of 0.086 parts per million by volume. It can be found in the gases which evolve from certain mineral springs. Commercially it is obtained by extraction from liquid air.
