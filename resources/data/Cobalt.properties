Appearance=A lustrous, silvery metal with a blue cast. It can be magnetised like iron and so is used to make magnets, as well as in ceramics and paints. The radioactive isotope cobalt-60 is used in medical treatment and, in some countries, to irradiate food to preserve it. Cobalt is an essential element for humans since it is part of vitamin B12. The amount needed is very small, and the body contains only about 1 milligramme. 
Uses=Cobalt metal is used in electroplating because of its attractive appearance, hardness and resistance to oxidation. It is alloyed with iron, nickel and other metals, and used in jet turbines and gas turbine generators. Cobalt salts have been used for centuries to produce brilliant blue colours in porcelain, glass, pottery and enamels. It can be magnetised like iron and so is used to make magnets, as well as in ceramics and paints. Radioactive cobalt-60 is used in the treatment of cancer.
Biological_role=Cobalt is an essential trace element, and forms part of the active site of vitamin B12. The amount needed is very small, and the body contains only about 1 milligramme. Cobalt salts in small doses have been found to be effective in correcting mineral deficiencies in certain animals. Cobalt in large doses is carcinogenic. Radioactive artificial cobalt-60 is an important gamma-ray source, and is used extensively as a tracer and radiotherapeutic agent. The radioactive isotope cobalt-60 is sometimes used in some countries to irradiate food to preserve it.
Natural_abundance=Cobalt is found in the minerals cobaltite, smaltite and erythrite. Important ore deposits are found in Zaire, Morocco and Canada. There is evidence that the floor of the north central Pacific Ocean may have cobalt-rich deposits.
