## Introduction

This is the periodic table I made in 10th standard. My school curriculum had
Java which is the first ever programming language using which I built a slightly
complex software interacting with different real-world components. Of course, at
that time internet wasn't always available which is why the data had to be
shipped along with code. I distinctly remember my course work excluded file
handling and GUI programs. If I had stuck to my course work I couldn't
never be making any software with persistent data or make it interact with
the real world. Glad I had already purchased "Java: The Complete Reference" by
Herbert Schildt and spent majority of my time reading that instead of the
course work books. 

Very luckily the source code along with the binary data has been preserved by
me and this really helps me in reminiscing those days. I don't think I would
ever want to take it off the internet. I should be clicking photos, who knows
whether JVM would last decades, but these memories of mine definitely should :)
